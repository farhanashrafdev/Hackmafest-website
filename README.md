## BASE CODE:

The base code of the repo was cloned from Limbo hacks 8/21/2021. According to
Owners of this code mentioned " Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as
much as you want." , so we have customized the Website according to HackmaFest
Needs. And we are happy to allow everyone to customize the website as much as
they want or use it as it is for thier use. we wont claim any copy rights or
anythings. We have so far added Speakers and Workshops Sections.
